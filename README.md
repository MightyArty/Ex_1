Basically we recieving a couple of calls as csv files and a couple of building data as json files
And in each call we are sending the best allocated elevator for this call
The project contains a Building class, Elevator class, Calls class, Node class (in which we store the calls data)
And the algo class, which is calculating and finding the best elevator by given information in the calls list.
